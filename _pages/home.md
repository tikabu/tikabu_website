# Our Company

Tikabu provides premium consulting services in secure DevOps. Focusing on clients with a predominantly Microsoft technology stack, we help our customers become more agile at delivering solutions to their customers.

* Does your business suffer from slow delivery timelines that are prone to errors?
* Are the applications and infrastructure you’re building or consuming today cloud-ready?
* Are you truly aware of the infrastructure and applications that are running in your environments?
* Are you confident that the security measures you have in place are correctly reporting your current security posture?

The Tikabu team has more than 30 years of combined experience in enterprise technology, working across infrastructure, application development, and security for one of Australia’s biggest financial institutions as well as smaller organisations. This experience has given us a unique perspective not only on the problems that companies face in the lightning-fast realm of today’s technology, but also on the solutions that will enable businesses to capitalise on available technologies.

Although the Linux space has been using DevOps practices with great success for many years, most companies are still struggling with their Microsoft technology stacks. Microsoft, however, has made massive investments in its management tools over the last 10 years, which means this no longer needs to be the case:

* The PowerShell scripting language has garnered an enormous following and has become a premier instrument in the DevOps toolkit. It’s now open-source and available on both Windows and Linux systems.
* Azure is Microsoft’s answer to the cloud challenge, as its seamless integration and increasing popularity indicate.
* Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services provides a comprehensive build-and-deployment platform for software development.

In addition to working closely with the Microsoft tech stack, we’ve also worked with heterogeneous environments that include such tools as Jenkins, UrbanCode Deploy, Artifactory, Octopus Deploy, TeamCity, and Atlassian’s tool suite.

You’ve invested in the technologies. Now let Tikabu help you make the most of them. We’ve developed a suite of tools and techniques to streamline the delivery of code from your developers to your customers. Whether you need:

* help adopting containers;
* assistance with environment management;
* help creating disposable environments or infrastructure as code;
* advice on a more traditional continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD); pipeline; or
* recommendations around security,

Tikabu can tick those boxes for you.

We specialise in helping organisations embark on the DevOps journey and achieve practical and measurable goals that add value to your business. We work directly with your staff to understand your business needs and IT challenges. Then, we start with the fundamentals of code management, automated testing, and, most important, kaizen – a philosophy of continuous improvement of the practices and people across your business. All the while, we ensure that security remains at the forefront of everything we do.
